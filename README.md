# TravelMadeSimple 

## Inspiration
We like to travel a lot, and we found that there is no place where you can find all important information about a city, things like flights, public transport options, places to visit or tips from other users.

## What it does
We didn't had time to implement all that we wanted, but for now you can check tips added by other users about the city that you want to visit. Also you can manage your trips & tips and the admin can manage the users that are signed-up into the application.

## How we built it
The backend it's built with node.js, express and mysql. And the fronted with react.js

## Challenges we ran into
One of the teammates died :(

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Ending the hackathon with something that we can show and demo besides of the problems that we had during the 24h of the event

## What we learned
We learned how to make a good backend, and frontend with react, that was a technology that we never used.

## What's next for Travel Made Simple
Add information about flights to the city that you want to go and price alerts. Also, we can implement a lot more of features that will be super useful.
